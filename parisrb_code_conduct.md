# ParisRB is about Ruby on Rails
and all web technologies, business topics... are welcome.  
It's a good thing to be curious, so anything related to developers' interests is OK.

**We value everyone's contribution and well-being.**  
As for any social interactions, respect and courtesy are expected.  
This event is a gathering of professionals, behave as such.


## We value our attendees
You came all the way to hear tech-related talks and share the passion: welcome!

**We do not accept rude, violent, sexist or racist behaviour.**  
Diversity is important for us, as we learn most from people who are most different.  
Make everyone feel welcomed is only achieved from constant effort from everyone.

Please take some time when choosing words, and wonder if they're appropriate for all audiences.  
As everything tends to be published (twitter, meetup, vimeo...), you will be called on it.  


## We value our speakers
They took time and effort to bring value to everyone.

**You are welcome to speak**, that's our effort to be an inclusive community.  
If you found out something interesting, it probably is to other people.  
Please note we do not review or endorse presentations.  
If in doubt, contact the organisers.

**You are welcome to experiment** on talks, topics, presentations...  
If you'd like opinions on your upcoming theme or talk,  
contact an organizer or gather feedback a month in advance.

**We do not accept speaker-bashing** as they've put time and effort.  
Criticism is important and valuable, only if constructive.  
This means kind, polite, on facts and not ad hominem, and providing inputs.  
A simple rule is that, if you're unhappy, you're welcome to do better yourself next time.


## If you feel something is wrong, speak up
either to the offender, the staff, or publicly. Point to this policy if needed.  
We know it's difficult to handle things yourself, so we'll help take appropriate action.  

For all details not in this text, the [PyCon Code of Conduct](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct) is a great example.
